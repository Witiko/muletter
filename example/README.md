This directory contains example documents for the various workplaces at
the Masaryk University (Brno, Czech Republic). You can typeset the
individual documents by running the [LaTeXMK][] tool on them
(`latexmk document.tex`). [LaTeXMK][] should be included in your TeX
distribution.  The typeset document will reside in the file
`document.pdf`.
